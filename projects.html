This page includes the list of workbooks I've detailed on through my blog. They include a mix of workbooks from studying materials, and personal work (which have been labeled).

<a href="/project-date.html">Sort by date</a>

{% assign projects = site.projects | sort: 'date' %}
{% for project in projects %}
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.date | date: "%b %Y" }} - {{ project.title }}</a></li>
  </ul>
{% endfor %}
