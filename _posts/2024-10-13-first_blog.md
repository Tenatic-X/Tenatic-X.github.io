# 2024.10.13 First blog post!

Working through a ML & data science course from Udemy right now. He suggests to create a blog to archive and keep track on the shit I'm currently working on/in the future.

Definitely like the idea to write down my thoughts and ideas on paper (text in this case), or else I'll forget everything lol.


## Future projects
Course has mentioned to stand out, where you wanna have to create your own works/projects that compounds your knowledge into actual on-the-job skills. It'd be beneficial if we can document my work-in-progress for a personal project.

Luckily, I've some semi-structural data, recording my weight(kg), waist circumference(cm), calories(kcal), and macros(g) for over 4 years. I have some ideas for this specific dataset.

I do have another one that states the hours of productivity I've made (in hours), split into what type of productivity I'm doing (e.g. drawing, coding etc.) Haven't figured out what to do with the data, but thinking of asking help from chatgpt.


## My career prospects?
ML and data science is still quite broad in terms of a career. Still wondered what kind of data science and ML I'd like to do?

So I decided to consult chatgpt, and see what career options may suit me as a newbie.

* ML Engineer - 90~160k - High/Very High demand
* Data Scientist (predictive modelling) - 90~140k - High demand
