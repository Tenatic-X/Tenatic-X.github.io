# 2024-10-13 First blog post!

Working through a ML & data science course from Udemy right now. He suggests to create a blog to archive and keep track on the shit I'm currently working on/in the future.

Definitely like the idea to write down my thoughts and ideas on paper (text in this case), or else I'll forget everything lol.

Bye
