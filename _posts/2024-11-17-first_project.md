# My very first personal data science/ML project!

## Overview and tasks
I've been working on a personal data science for the past week now, and it's been pretty exciting. I've kept record of my weight and waist measurements for over 4 years, including caloric and macro intake, and figured this dataset would be perfect for me to upskill myself with all the works and studies I've been doing so far in this journey!

## Challenges and solutions
It's difficult to remember all the tid bit things about what to include in a data science project. So I've been utilizing all the past milestone projects, and study jupyter notebooks on what I'm missing in my work. It's proven tedious to siphen through different notebooks, but it helps fill up loose ends and holes.

The other challenge I learnt, is the ML model will have to make predictions, on top of previous predictions of weight. It's not the typical regression problem, where you have a bunch of features, and the ML uses it to predict a price, or an amount. This requires predicting on the change/difference of a value, and that value's prediction is added into the value, which then further affects the next prediction. This makes it a lot more difficult to keep the model accurate, as any slight deviation, will cause the model to predict very strange results. But I'm definitely curious to see how well they can predict, and do something I'm less familiar with.

## Learnings and insight
So far, nothing too groundbreaking. Biggest thing is realizing how regression problems can vary more than just 'predicting the price that a bulldozer would sell at an auction'. It definitely makes the work more fun and interesting as I'm learning to problem solve around my project, but obviously can be pretty pissed at how unnessecarily complicated some things can become lol.
