# Week 2

## Overview
This week, I'm learning how to create a webpage animation through the use of CSS and HTML code, to participate in an little open source community project from Zero To Mastery, named hacktoberfest.

## Projects and Tasks
* Create animation for ZTM Hacktoberfest: _I'm gonna learn how to use html and css (since I've never used them before), to create an animation for an open source project on the zero to mastery repo._

## Challenges and Solutions
### How to animate in CSS and HTML?
Main challenge was learning what CSS and HTML actually do, since I know fuck all about both coding languages lmao. I started out by observing other people's animation code. But it wasn't of much help, as the ones I checked wrote zero comments on their code. Explaining nothing on what their code does. So I decided to look at online tutorials on what CSS and HTML does. Didn't help as much either, as it often was extremely wordy, and takes a paragraph to explain like one simple function, and the code is written for HTML, not CSS. Plus its not the kind of animation I want to create.

To my solution with the animation I had in mind, I searched for CSS animation ideas, and landed on this [page](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-animation-examples), showcasing 30 different animation. The rolling box on 11 got my attention, and decided to copy the code, and start tweaking it myself. And with learning what CSS and HTML does, I went back to chatgpt instead of the online resources. It provides me concise info often, and can specifically narrow down to the answers I'm looking for to my queries. 

### Cubic-bezier animation timing
The next big problem is finding out how to use the cubic-bezier animation ease _(which is a timing based animation, dictating how slow or fast an animation moves from point A to B over a period of time. Like starts moving slow, then moves fast)_, since it's hard to visualize an easing graph with just four numbers in a bracket (0, 0, 0, 0).

Solution was asking chatgpt for help, and it directed me to this [site](https://cubic-bezier.com/#.83,.22,.18,.84), where it allowed you to toy around the easing graph to get the write ease you want for an animation keyframe! Was very helpful in visualizing the movement I wanted in the animation, and fortunately, I was familiar with the graph from doing a lot of 2d animation projects!

### Box, rolling back to its starting position
The other problem was, I wanted the hill rotate down, and have the box fall down onto it, then rotate back to its starting position, following a sort of curved trajectory, staying on top of the hill. This was difficult for the fact, that there isn't really any easy way I was able to find to have the box follow a curved trajectory, rather than a straight one.

Solution was to just add a lot of keyframes, and really finesse the translation position of the box, its degree of turn, the % time of keyframe, and hardest of all, having the cubic-bezier ease flow together well enough that it looks like a cohesive animation of a box, rolling back on the hill in a sort of curved trajectory. It took a lot of trial and error, to get it good enough.

## Learnings and Insights
I've learnt the HTML mainly displays elements that are formed from itself, or from another file, and CSS mainly does specific smaller elements, that can then be used anywhere on the webpage, without copy pasting code and making the webpage run more efficiently. In simpler python-analogy, HTML is just the code of python, and CSS acts as a python function that a code in python can call upon when needed. I've made sure I commented on my HTML and CSS code, so I can refer back to it if I need a refresher, or other people want a better understanding of the code, or how CSS and HTML works sorta.

The easing was easily understood, after being able to visualize it as a graph.

From the picture above, it shows how the 2 nodes, have a x and y positioning on the easing graph. It is arranged as (x1, y1, x2, y2), and dictates how you want your animation ease be. It's so much easier to both visualize it, and interact with it, in addition to testing how the easing looks, compared to a linear animation.

I've gained little insight on the coding projects of other students, whom particpated in Hacktoberfest. It seems that barely if anyone put any comments on their animation codes. Not explaining what each part of the code does, and what roles they play. Didn't help me understand what the code should do, and of course, not exactly ideal in a working environment where communication is quite important on the job.

## Next Steps
Maybe continue looking for other open source projects, where I get to collaborate and communicate with fellow computer nerds like me, to create something awesome. Not sure where to start, but some google searching should do the trick!

## Reflections
Still very new and inexperienced in many coding aspects. Sometimes I'm a bit scared of new coding languages that I'm unfamiliar with, but it helps to understand them a bit, since now you know how they are supposed to work with each other! :)
