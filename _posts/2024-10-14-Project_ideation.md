# Project Ideation
Thinking about the personal projects to create once I finish this course, I figured that the communication portion is going to be a bit of a challenge compared to technical aspects.

With communication, I'm thinking of creating two different presentations for two separate niches. Teammates and Project Manager.

## Creation
Will try use powerpoint, and create a script with summarized points to then self record myself, presenting the presentation. (Always thought the presentation projects at high school were for nothing lol)
Have to figure out what slides to include based on the niches as well.

## Niche's interests: (Will consult a bit of google and chatgpt, to figure out what points they'd be interested in my project)
Teammate:
* More technically savvy
* Interested in tools/details that help me achieve my results

Project Manager:
* The things that has held me back in progress
*
