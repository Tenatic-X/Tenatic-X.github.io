### convoluted use of tfds.load - on top of 07 workbook

### shuffle_files=True causing difficulties with shuffling test data as well

### Chatgpt is a hallucinating retard, and I should've spent time testing and playing the code it gave

### My findings on food 101 class' wrong predictions and confusions

## Next steps
Continue to finish up the workbook 07.

## Reflection
It's nice to be on adhd pills (rubifen). Now I feel like I can get stuff done lol.
