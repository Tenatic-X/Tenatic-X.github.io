# Week 16

## Overview
Updating on what stuff I've been on to. Life got really busy and eventually forgot to update my blog, over focusing on the code portion and other more important details in life.

## Project and Tasks
* Completing Phase 2 work of NZMSA

## Challenges and Learnings

### Part 1 and 2 were straightforward
Things that have been taught through phase 1 were then utilized in parts 1 and 2. 

### Part 3's a complete fuckery
I'll cut to the bullshit, the whole part is absolute bullshit. During phase 1 when they explained the image learning or knowledge distillation contents, it was filled with theory bullshit, with long ass code thats not explained to us at all. Then when you reach part 3, where you do the knowledge distillation code work, the shit they want you to do is in PyTorch. The learning material is all in Tensorflow. Completely different than the operation I was used to, which is Tensorflow. Worst of all, your code and it's accuracy on the test image dataset is worth 10 points. The other part was the report submission, worth 50 fucking points. They want you to write in that thesis-scientist-like bullshit, with references to other papers, and this fuckery was never explained nor taught to us in phase 1, yet it's supposed to be worth the majority of our scores? Then the fuck is the point with learning the code and semi-narcissitic theory lessons that's not explained properly?

Abolute state of this coursework has me frustrated. I've spent quite the time trying to learn what each line of code does in PyTorch that Chatgpt has spewed at me, and then written it in the code for communication and understanding purposes, to only realise too close to the deadline that I should've been focusing my eyes on the report submission paper this entire time. A piece of shit document where you utilise your subject in english, inside a coding coursework, and that's meant to dictate the majority of your grade. How the fuck does that make sense???

### Knowledge Distillation training bottleneck

I've spent a few hours trying to sort out the bottleneck issue with the batch loop in the KD model. Seems most of the time it gets stuck at the teacher/student pass, and when backpropagating to the start of the loop. Think it took about 4-5 hours of computer usage to only get up to epoch 3 out of 50.

Currently i'm shoving whatever into chatgpt and just copy pasting the code in. I'll try understand the changes made later as to not waste time understanding if it's not working at all.

## Next steps

FInish up phase 3 part 3, and see how much i can get done in the report submission

## Reflection

Absolutely hate everything about this coursework right now. Barely any novel items I've learnt from phase 1, has been any use to me, and I have to relearn from scratch to understand what the fuck is going on. Will just see how much I can finish, and not stress about it if I can't finish in time of deadline. Will just put in what I've done.
