# Week 7

## Relevant Project
[01_extra_cirricular_task](https://tenatic-x.github.io/projects/(homework)%2001_extra_cirricular_task.html)

## Overview
I continued with ZtM TensorFlow 01 workbook, doing their extra cirricular exercise of creating our own ML model/neural network. I also thought that, it would be a good idea to showcase my workbooks on my blog as well, so that well I got shit backing up what I'm talking about, and that I'm not yapping outta my ass lmao.

## Project and Tasks
* Complete 01's extra-cirricular contents: *We fabricate our training and test data, then go in depth to find the best ML model hyperparameters for the prediction of my data*
* Export workbook to blog site: *Figure out how to export my .ipynb workbook from Visual Studio Code, and uploading it into a readable format on my blog*

## Challenges and Learnings

### Create our data for ML model/neural network:
Because of my familiarity of the basics of ML model from the aforementioned MSA project, I want the data the model is working with, to be complex, rather than the linear one from workbook 01. So I thought, using `sine` as one of the factors to form our `y` data will create that complexity I want in my data. And this is how it looks:

Pretty cool aye?

Due to difficulty, rather than 80/20 split, its a 90/10 training and testing data split. 

### Linear prediction by the ML model:
One major frustration while training the ML model with the data, is it seems to continuously default to predicting linearly. Which obviously won't work, as our data aint linear. Most optimization of model have the same linear issue, except implementing activation functions. Makes sense, as they have specified function that can more so align with the `sine` effect `y` data has.

Sinusoidal seems to do best in model accuracy, as naturally it uses `sine` as a core basis to its function activation.

### Model trial and error:
There was a lot of trial and error process with our model, especially tuning the hyperparameters and adding/removing model layers/activation function. I've probably done 50+ different model configurations, and have documented all the changes I've made on the model, what worked, what was changed back, and what was removed, in addition to adding what their loss value is, as walls of text aint the best way to gauge difference when compared to numbers and values.

### Exporting and implementing my past workbooks into the blog

This was easily one of the most fucking frustrating things to finess and figure out. :(

Initially, I thought it was gonna be easy peasy, simply by dropping my workbook and its relevant files, and then any person could just open the workbook file and see what I was tinkering about. Except for some reason, the saved `.ipynb` file from `VS Code` had issues rendering on `Github`. So I had to figure out another way to export it. One where instead of exporting raw code, just have the preview of my workbook.

A few chatgpting and googling determined, that `HTML` would be the go to. Went through VS code extensions, save as options, export options through `Shift+Ctrl+P`, but to no avail. Don't know how long I spent going around in circles, but found that I had to install this thing `pip install nbconvert PyPDF2`, to then use `Shift+Ctrl+P` and type in `Jupyter: Convert to HTML`. Finally, the workbook was exported as HTML.

Next was to upload to github. Again was not as easy as I thought. Thought I could upload the `HTML` file, and have the code just pop up its visualization, but it only displayed the inner codes of the HTML instead. So the next step is adding it onto my blog post, which uses `HTML` and actually displays stuff. By this point, my head fucking hurts and I had no energy figuring anything of this web shit myself. So I had ChatGPT do 90% of the work for me, and help me figure out how to get my `HTML` file onto my blog.

And Ta-dah! It worked, sort of. Only issues is that every project has a useless category/title on top. Tried fixing it but to no avail, so that's an issues for another time. What's most important is I got the fucking code on my blog woooo!!!!


## Next steps

Continue onwards to workbook 02 of the TensorFlow Course, and also add in the relevant workbooks onto my blog posts from now on at the top of the page.

## Reflection

I know that the amount I've spent on trying to get the model accurate was overkill lol. There's a rule where 20% of the work gets you 80% of perfection. But 80% of the rest of the work, gets you that last 20%. There's a diminishing result with how long you test or let the model run it's epochs. This was more of a fluke for me to see the model's capabilities, but certainly may not be the most optimal in real world scenarios, especially that 1000 epochs for the final model lol.

I feel brain dead rn lol. I hate `HTMl` and don't understand it. But I'm willing to go through the pain to showcase my work in a very convenient manner!
