# Week 17

## Relevant Work
[Part 1 ipynb](https://github.com/Tenatic-X/nzmsa_2025/blob/main/part_1/part1-submission.ipynb)

[Part 2 ipynb](https://github.com/Tenatic-X/nzmsa_2025/blob/main/part_2/part2_submission_DeanChung.ipynb)

[Part 3 ipynb](https://github.com/Tenatic-X/nzmsa_2025/blob/main/part_3/src/part3.ipynb)

## Overview
Continuing with trying to fix up nzmsa phase 2, part 3 knowledge distillation.

## Project and Tasks
* Continue debugging knowledge distillation on phase 2, part 3

## Challenges and Learnings

### Knowledge Distillation training bottleneck solved

A little wrangling later, it turns out I can save a lot of time by instead of calling the teacher batches in the training loop, I can firstly create the batches outside of it, save the file, and then have the training loop pull in the already created teacher batches.

It took 44 minutes to complete 5 epochs. Better than waiting an hour I guess.

I did have to sit through many errors, that I refused to comprehend it anymore and let chatgpt spew out what it thinks are the answers or solutions. At this point, I've really given up all hope for this project and became dissociated with it.

### Outputs only showed the same results

So One issue I had after training, was that the student model only picked the same answers for every single images. The first time was picking index `8`, giving only `sunglasses` as the answers to all the images.

After wrangling with the training bottleneck, it still did the same thing, but this time with index `0` for `african_elephant`. I think I'm going to pass on this project entirely and focus back on studying materials, as this is no longer contributing to my learning at all, but all to do with increasing my own suffering.

### Why does PyTorch exist when TensorFlow works easier?

It seems based on a reddit post I read on the preference of `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`, `PyTorch` is mainly used on research papers often due to it's ability to heavy customize and micro manage architectures, allowing new possible discoveries to then be written upon during research.

Constrasting `TensorFlow`, is better for production or industry related works, as the codes are often non-customizeable, and automates the smaller processes and steps that you will need to write out in `PyTorch`.

### NZMSA team has discarded my submission for not creating an Azure SQL Server

One thing that I haven't mentioned, is the first step wants you to create an `Azure SQL` server, from the step by step tutorials that was written out in the learning materials work. I thought I had to complete the reading materials and gave evidence of me completing the read work, rather it was intended that you create the 'actual' servers for them to access.

So they've removed my submission before even touching my coding submissions.

Pretty shitty to have that tagged on the submissions, when last year that was not included. Not only that, it was mundane step by step mindless processes of creating an SQL server, that seemed no more than a brute forced, free advertising of Microsoft's third-party services to uni students, and their capabilities compared to other known PaaS services. Which funnily enough, is materials that can only be accessed by university student's valid email account. You have to go through some big loops just to create access to a server from written step by step instructions, that you will remember fuck all after a week of deploying it.

Absolute fucking cunts to tag a more than likely promotional gag of their microsoft services that has nothing to do with your ability to code or analyze data, but everything to do with if you know how to follow a dumbass tutorial that you could literally find on fucking youtube when in a pinch.

## Next steps

Forgo the entire NZMSA phase 2 work, and post up what work I've done on the blog. Will discard the report paper entirely as it will not benefit me the slightest as of now.

## Reflection

Again, horrendous coursework and learning materials done on the part of the NZMSA team. Don't think I will enrol for next year. Thought I may try my hands on possibly hitting an internship after learning and doing the coursework from what I've managed to self taught, but ended up learning how much university-type work/studies is absolutely shit, and furthers my correct opinion and choice to drop out years ago.

I've definitely been very angry, frustrated, and annoyed by this entire project. Luckily the time spent weren't all in vain, as at least I know what I like or don't like with coding or general ideas. Hoping to move back to ztm tensorflow coursework soon after posting my NZMSA work.

I think at the end of the day, I realize I'm not much of a researcher-type kind of guy, but more industry-type. I'd rather spend hours on analyzing on data trends and solving problems with the data provided, rather spending hours on discovering new ways to make a certain process more efficient in time that involves many steps.
