# Week 24

## Overview
Continuing on tensorflow

## Project and Tasks
* Uploading notebooks to github


## Challenges and Learnings

### Food model is extremely sensitive to images
Using food pictures, not dishes, and not presented nicely on a plate - very different from its database, good stress test

### Use of `mixed_precision`
Speeds up training, but only if u rich with good gpu

### Html is a picky bitch :( - created quick guide html notebook
error 404, %raw% use, spent 2 hours solving why page wont load

## Next steps
Continue to finish up the workbook 06.

## Reflection
N/A, just been a bit slow with the study sessions, and spending a lot of downtime at work, trying to understand ulmfit: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146
