# Week 3 & 4

## Relevant Project
[00_tensorflow_fundamentals](https://tenatic-x.github.io/projects/(STUDY)_00_tensorflow_fundamentals.html)

## Overview
For the past 2 weeks, I was working on a new ML learning course while my personal project is on hold. So far I've completed the first notebook, learning tensors and a bit of neural networks.

## Project and Tasks
* Finish ZTM Notebook 00: *Finish going through and retyping the first notebook on `Visual Code Studio`, and use ChatGPT to help explain processes I was unfamiliar with.*

## Challenges and Learnings

### Wtf are tensors?
At first, I was pretty intimidated by tensors, not knowing what they do and how neural networks even use tensors to do model predictions on given data. But the more I completed this project, the more I was familiar with the concept, as it was a lot like NumPy arrays, 
with 1, 2 or more dimensions in the array. And that the values within the tensors are simply directions given for the neural networks to predict things, and this gets refined overtime. What is slightly annoying, is that they have specific names for the level of dimwensions
the tensors is in. `Scalar` = 1, `Vector` = 2, `Matrix` = 3, and `Tensor` = 4> dimensions.

### Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication is weird, and is still weird after understanding how you are supposed to multiply it. There's a series of steps you follow to properly multiply two different matrixes:

1. The inner dimensions of both matrixes must be of the same value.
2. Choose either Tensor A or B, and turn them 90 degrees clockwise.
3. Say we rotated Tensor A, start multiplying the inner column of A, with B's column. For every individual column in B, = to a value. (E.g. B has 5 columns. Multiply Tensor A's inner column with each column of Tensor B, and you'll get 5 results).
4. Put multiplicated values in a row, on the order of when you multiplied them by column.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, for the next column on Tensor A's roster, and input the results below the previous row of multiplied values.

Obviously its quite hard to explain it in words, but much easier through visuals. Though this one is slightly different in the order they multiply.

### Decorators - `@tf.functions`
Decorators are pretty much another version of functions that you normally define in your code. But they have a specialty use. It is something you use along with a function, and it acts a lot like the bread (decorator), for the filling (function). It has very important
usage for logging purposes, timing code runtime, or others that allows modification and extensions over an existing function in the code. Great for code reusability when you want a logging function applied to certain functions in the existing code.

A code exemplar:
```python
def sandwich_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("üçû This is the top slice of bread.")
        func()
        print("üçû This is the bottom slice of bread.")
    return wrapper

@sandwich_decorator
def my_filling():
    print("ü•ì Here‚Äôs the delicious filling!")

my_filling()
```

And it outputs:
```
üçû This is the top slice of bread.
ü•ì Here‚Äôs the delicious filling!
üçû This is the bottom slice of bread.
```

## Next steps

There's a few extra-cirricular materials at the end of this notebook, and I'm making a habit to go through a few, especially ones that have me work on another notebook. Best to study on more contents, suggested by the author of these notebooks!

## Reflection

I feel like I've fallen pretty short on the quantity of hours spent on studying data science, and it's quite depressing how many time elapsed to finish this notebook. Hope the inevitable doom of growing up and old as an adult, further disciplines me to complete these
courses, and continue working on personal projects as well.
