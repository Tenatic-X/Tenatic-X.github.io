title: Project List

This page includes the list of workbooks I've detailed on through my blog. They include a mix of workbooks from "study" materials, to "homework" that came from these study materials, and "personal" work (which have been labeled).

{%- assign allprojects = site.projects | sort: 'date' | reverse %}

<ul>
  {%- for project in allprojects %}
    {%- assign filename = project.path | split: '/' | last | remove: '.md' %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ filename | replace: '-', ' ' | capitalize }}</a> 
      - {{ project.date | date: "%b %Y" }}
      <span class="category {{ project.category }}">{{ project.category | capitalize }}</span>
    </li>
  {%- endfor %}
</ul>
